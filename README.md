# Klory
A variation of the Klor keyboard by GEIGEIGEIST (https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/KLOR).

## Introduction

This is a guide to my experiences buiding Klory, my variant of the Klor keyboard. This was my first keyboard build and GEIST did an outstanding job
documenting the build process in the GitHub repository. The changes I made were mainly due to my inexperince. Some were just personal preference 
differences.

Spoiler alert! I love Klory and am buiding a second for home.

## Why the Klor

I was using a Planck Ez with a 3x5 layout in which I was not using the center 6 keys above the spacebar. I was using four thumb keys in my layout. 
However, I felt that my thumbs were cramp and wanted a split keyboard.

I started off looking for just a split Planck, but then I decided I wanted row stagger. I really liked the Corne, but I was using four thumb keys on my
Planck layout. This was mainly because I was having trouble using the space as a layer key; the timing was causing a lot of errors. 

Therefore, the main reasons for the Klor were:
- four thumb keys
- thumb keys not requiring folding thumb under hand
- thumb keys in a curve

There were several nice to haves:
- encoder support
- the option of moving the pinkie out for the Q and P key instead of up.
- KB2040 support
- trackball support

I was not interested in:
- OLED
- haptic feedback
- sound

I really wanted the per key LEDs and partially decided on a wired solution to get the LEDs. However, after the initial excitment of having LEDs on the 
Planck, I decided that it didn't have a lot of value. I also wasn't sure which LEDs to order.
