# Parts

Here is where I ordered the parts for my keyboard in the spring of 2023. This list will get stale overtime.

| Part Name | Vender | Notes |
| :--- | :---   | :--- |
| PCB  | [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) | I ordered a green PCB instead of a black one because it was 2+ days faster. Minimum order was 5. |
| MCU  | [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5302) | KB2040 |
| MX Key switch | Amazon | When you include shipping, you can get some better deals here than other vendors. But, I had to order 65. |
| switch socket | [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4958) | Kaihl Switch Socket|
| diodes 1N4148W| [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5099) | |
| 1u MX keycaps | [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4997) | DSA keycaps in multiple colors. |
| OLED module   | N/A | Did not use. |
| reset button  | N/A | Did not use. The KB2040 has a reset button on it. Also, I was building a wired version and can just unplug it. |
| ~~TRRS jack~~ JST-SH Connector | [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4208) | Currently, hardwired, I have purchased this instead of TRRS. |
| ~~TRRS cable~~  JST-SH Cable | [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5385) | Currently, hardwired, but purchased this instead of TRRS. |
| EC11N1524402 encoder  | [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Alps-Alpine/EC11N1524402?qs=W%2FMpXkg%252BdQ5mmk2EdvtXAA%3D%3D) | Planning to use this one, but have not installed it yet. |
| encoder knob  | N/A | Thinking of adapting the [Klotz Knob](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/KLOTZ/tree/main/knob), but haven't yet. |
| USB cable     | N/A | Using one I already had. I recommend a super flexible cable. Some usb-c video cables are too stiff. |


## OPTIONAL PARTS

I was going to use the pins that come with the KB2040 and these [headers from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/598). However, I didn't think the combination worked that well. The headers while shorter than normal are still a little tall and the pins are a little long for them.

I ended up ordering these sockets from [TyperActive](https://typeractive.xyz/products/ez-machine-sockets-and-headers). They are expensive when you consider that the KB2040 itself is a $1 cheaper. However, they work well. I highly recommend getting sockets as I it nice being able to remove the MCU when you want to make a mod to your PCB. I was thinking that I could just unsolder the sockets if I wanted to move them to another board, but It isn't that easy to unsolder. I am a novive at desoldering though. Order a couple of extras and get free shipping.

## Case Parts

I printed my own 3D parts and cut my own acrylic. I ended up making very different cases which I will detail later. Here are the parts I ordered:


| Part Name | Vender | Notes |
| :--- | :---   | :--- |
| M2 Screws | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/6NNHfAM) | Lots of different sizes of screws gave me flexibilty when I designed my own case |
| Bass Standoffs in mutiple sizes | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/2GAflAl)  |   |
| Bass Standoffs - 7mm | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/j9lGEjD)  |   |

After I made my Amazon orders, I ended up finding standoffs at [Keeb.io](https://keeb.io/collections/diy-parts/products/m2-screws-and-standoffs). I haven't ordered these, but have ordered other items from Keeb.io.
