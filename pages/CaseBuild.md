# Building the Case

As you know from the other sections, I moved the position of the MCU from the bottom to the top of the PCB. This means that I have to change the case to
adjust to this change. There are a set of changes that need to be made to made the original case work with the moved MCU. These include moving the hole in
the case for the USB connector, covering up the holes for the Reset and TRRS, making a hole in the switchplate for the MCU, and covering the hole in the
bottom for the MCU to fit. In addition, the Klor case has a plate that fits over the switch plate. This plate will not fit over the MCU in the position on top.

However, I ended up with a bigger issue. It is probably either due to me doing something wrong or to the hotswap sockets that I used, but in my case build
the distance between the PCB and the switchplate was too small. The keyswitches would not fully snap into the switchplate. Also when you tried to pull the 
switches out, the switchplate would move up as you pulled up.

As a result, I essentially redesigned the case. It is a combination of 3D printed and laser cut. It ends up slightly smaller and shorter than the orginal
case.
