# Building the Case

As you know from the other sections, I moved the position of the MCU from the bottom to the top of the PCB. This means that I have to change the case to
adjust to this change. There are a set of changes that need to be made to made the original case work with the moved MCU. These include moving the hole in
the case for the USB connector, covering up the holes for the Reset and TRRS, making a hole in the switchplate for the MCU, and covering the hole in the
bottom for the MCU to fit. In addition, the Klor case has a plate that fits over the switch plate. This plate will not fit over the MCU in the position on top.

However, I ended up with a bigger issue. It is probably either due to me doing something wrong or to the hotswap sockets that I used, but in my case build
the distance between the PCB and the switchplate was too small. The keyswitches would not fully snap into the switchplate. Also when you tried to pull the 
switches out, the switchplate would move up as you pulled up.

As a result, I essentially redesigned the case. 

## Overview

The new case is essentially a stack case and is a combination of 3D printed and laser cut. It ends up slightly smaller and shorter than the orginal case.

I limited myself to using the existing holes in the PCB and not drilling new holes. It would have been nice if the holes in the PCB were for M2 screws
instead of M2 standoffs, but we got it to work.

Here are the pieces to the case.

| Part | Build | Details | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bottom Plate | laser cut 1.6 mm acrylic or 3D printed | This piece is smaller than in the original Klor case. There are holes for M2 screws. | I laser cut mine from clear acrylic scrap |
| Side Plate no hole | 3D printed | There are holes for M2 standoffs 9mm. | It has and "h" profile for the PCB to rest on. |
| PCB | | The PCB also has holes for the M2 standoffs. | |
| Side Plate with hole | 3D printed | Hole is for the usb and TRRS connectors to go through | It also has "h" profile for switchplate to rest on. |
| Switchplate | 1.6 mm acrylic or 3D printed | Have cutouts for the MCU to poke up through | I did both acrylic and 3D printing versions |
| MCU Cover Frame | 3D Printed | This is a frame to hole a cover for the MCU. It also covers the encoder hole. | |
| MCU Cover | Laser Cut | Covers the MCU. | You could 3D print this with the part abhove. |

The key design element of this case is that the distance between the PCB and the switchplate is fixed. The "h" shaped side pieces are what makes this 
happen.
